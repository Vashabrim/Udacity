# Downtown Des Moines Best Burgers and Beers

I created this project for the Udacity Front-End Web developer nanodegree.

It is showcasing some of the best places I like to eat here in Des Moines, and be able to get my favorite food combination, a burger and a beer. 

Since that is a lot of calories, and the places are relatively close together, clicking on the location will call on the Foursquare API to give you the names of several closeby gyms so you can work it off
before you get your next 'fix'.
